    <p>
      Cut the lines of code you need to build awesome stuff. Going from getting data to deploying a model in three hours, youâ€™ll get hands-on with the cutting-edge tidyverse packages that can at least halve the code you need to write!

    <h3 class="center">Upgrade Your Workflow with a Custom Package</h3>
    <h4 class="center">by Heather Turner</h4>

    <p>
      You might think that writing packages is only for R pros. But creating a
      custom package is a good way for anyone to formalise their workflow and
      if you can write an R function you can do it! This workshop will set you
      up to start using custom packages in your work and hobby projects.

    <h3 class="center">Data manipulation with dplyr</h3>
    <h4 class="center">by Katherine Tansey</h4>
    <h5 class="center">Admiral</h5>

    <p>
      The ability to reformat, generate relevant summary information, and merge datasets together are considered routine daily tasks. The R package dplyr has changed the way data manipulation and wrangling occurs within R. It is fast, has a simple syntax, and allows for commands to be chained together to increase efficiency. Learning dplyr is essential for any data analyst and can allow even novice coders to perform advanced manipulations. This workshop will go through the syntax and usage of the main functions to manipulate data using dplyr. We will cover how to filter rows, select columns, create summary statistics, and create new columns using existing information.
